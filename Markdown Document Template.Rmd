```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Front Material {.tabset}

Some intro stuff to say. Blah, blah, blah...

`{.tabset}` will automatically place the material under the next level of header (`###`) in a new tab. Cool beans.

### This is my new tab

Say some stuff here. 

Then create a code chunk.

```{r my_first_chunk}

summary(cars) #write some code

```

#### This will create a sub-header in a tab

I can add an image like this.

`<center>![](fixing_problems.png)</center>`

<center>![](fixing_problems.png)</center>

`<center>` is a brute-force way of telling Markdown to start centering some text or an image, `</center>` tells Markdown to stop centering. (This should be familiar to anyone who poked around with html code.) 


I can also change code chunk settings to make my documents purtier. There are lots of options. Here are a few.

```{r my_custom_chunk, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=4, fig.height=4}

plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)

```
